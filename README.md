# rust wasm tax calculator
A prototype for calculating tax using rust and wasm

## Development Setup
### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for package management
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)

### Development Server
This project uses `live-server` for development with the following features:
- 🔄 Automatic page reloading when files change
- 📦 Proper WASM MIME type handling
- 🌐 Cross-browser compatibility
- 🚀 Default port 8080

### Tailwind CSS Setup
This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The setup includes:
- **Tailwind CLI**: For processing and building CSS
- **PostCSS**: For additional CSS processing
- **Autoprefixer**: For adding vendor prefixes automatically

#### Configuration Files
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind configuration
- `postcss.config.js`: PostCSS configuration

#### Custom Styles
Custom styles are defined in `src/input.css` using Tailwind's utility classes and custom components.

#### Building CSS
To build and watch for changes in your CSS, run:

```bash
bun run tailwind
```

This will generate the `dist/output.css` file.

### Available Scripts
- `bun run build` - Build the WASM module
- `bun run build:dev` - Build the WASM module with development features
- `bun run serve` - Start the development server
- `bun run start` - Build and start the server
- `bun run test` - Run tests
- `bun run clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `bun run tailwind` - Build and watch Tailwind CSS

### Development Server Configuration
The server can be customized using the following options in package.json:
- `--port`: Change the port number (default: 8080)
- `--host`: Specify the host
- `--no-browser`: Prevent automatic browser opening
- `--quiet`: Suppress logging
- `--ignore`: Specify files to ignore for live reloading

### Local Development Workflow
For the best development experience, you'll need to run two commands in separate terminals:

#### Terminal 1: CSS Watcher
```bash
bun run tailwind
```
This command watches your CSS files for changes and rebuilds the output.css file automatically.

#### Terminal 2: Development Server
```bash
bun run serve
```
This starts the live-server that handles your application.

#### Why Two Terminals?
Running these commands separately ensures:
- 🔄 Live reloading works properly for both HTML/JS and CSS changes
- 📦 Tailwind can watch and rebuild CSS files immediately
- 🚀 The development server can pick up all changes instantly
- ⚡ Faster feedback loop during development

> **Note**: While you could combine these commands using a tool like `concurrently`, running them separately provides better visibility into any build errors that might occur.

## Tax Calculation Logic

The `calculate_tax` function in `src/lib.rs` is designed to compute the tax based on a given income using a progressive tax rate system. The function is accessible from JavaScript through WebAssembly, thanks to the `wasm_bindgen` annotation.

### Tax Brackets
The function uses the following tax brackets:

- **10%** on income up to $11,600
- **12%** on income over $11,600 up to $47,150
- **22%** on income over $47,150 up to $100,525
- **24%** on income over $100,525 up to $191,950
- **32%** on income over $191,950 up to $243,725
- **35%** on income over $243,725 up to $609,350
- **37%** on income over $609,350

### Calculation Method
The function calculates tax by applying the appropriate rate to the income within each bracket and summing the results. For example, if the income is $50,000, the tax is calculated as follows:

1. 10% on the first $11,600
2. 12% on the income between $11,600 and $47,150
3. 22% on the income between $47,150 and $50,000

This approach ensures that the tax is calculated progressively, with higher rates applied only to the income that falls within higher brackets.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Create a browser extension for the tax calculator feature
  - [ ] Build core WASM module for tax calculations
  - [ ] Implement browser extension architecture:
    - [ ] Background script for handling calculations
    - [ ] Content script for page integration
    - [ ] Popup interface for user interactions
  - [ ] Data persistence layer:
    - [ ] Utilize IndexedDB for storing tax calculation history
    - [ ] Cache frequently used tax rates and rules
  - [ ] Features:
    - [ ] Offline calculation support
    - [ ] History of previous calculations
    - [ ] Export functionality for tax records
    - [ ] Real-time tax calculation as users input values
